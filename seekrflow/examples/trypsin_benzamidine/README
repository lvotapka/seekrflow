To make the seekrflow input, one could run the following:

python ~/seekrflow/seekrflow/tools/make_input.py seekrflow.json

And open and modify the inputs as desired, especially the "receptor_ligand_pdb", and "ligand_resname", "auxiliary_forcefield_files", "anchor_radius_list", and run_settings entries. Most of the rest is automatic

Next, we can perform automatic parameterization:

WARNING: make sure to indicate in tutorials and documentation that automatic parametrization
can get protein chains wrong - what if there's a dimer?

python ~/seekrflow/seekrflow/parametrize.py protein_ligand.pdb -i seekrflow.json -L BEN

Next, prepare the model:

python ~/seekrflow/seekrflow/flow.py seekrflow.json prepare

python ~/seekrflow/seekrflow/flow.py seekrflow.json run
